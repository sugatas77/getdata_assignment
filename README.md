# Assessment 1 - `run_analyis.R` function

This repo contains the analysis code in R which can be run on the Samsung datasets to create the tidy dataset as per peer assignment requirements for "Getting and Cleaning Data Project"

## The R script `run_analysis.R` will:

1. Unzip and process the required data.
2. Label the columns of data sets accordingly.
3. Combine train and test datasets into one complete data set.
4. Create a second, independent tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
5. Write the `tidy_data.txt` to a space separated text file.


This script will create two new tidy data sets:

`tidy_data.txt`: shows a table with the means, grouped by subject and label.
